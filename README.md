# Financial Simulator

Learn how the decisions you make affect your finances.

You cannot change your income, but you can choose your lifestyle!

The goal is to live a good life, and have enough left over for retirement.

## Interface

There are 4 levels to the interface:

 1. Overview - shows your monthly and annual income and expendeture
 2. Breakdown - shows each component that makes up your finances, your income & assets, expenditure & liabilities.
 3. Minutiae - demonstrates component costs, on a month-to-month basis.
 4. Timeline - a log of the events that occur each month; from salary to interest paid, interest earned and stock adjustments.

## Experience

Time stops for no man.

Make decisions such as:

 * Which car to buy, or use the bus.
 * Rent a mansion or buy a flat.
 * Overpay your mortgage or go on holiday.
 * Invest in the stock market.

Your decisions compound over time, with the same salary you can become broke and desperate, or wealthy and comfortable.
