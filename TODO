    Income Allocation
    	Allocate all income
    		Rent
    		Bills
    		Mortgage
    		Car
    		etc.
    	Need options for "unspent" money
    		Put 50% in savings account
    		Put 50% in bonds
    	Warn me when "unspent" >= 1000 pcm
    		(later)

    Leftovers
    	To prevent cash just piling up, we need to assume that anything unaccounted
    	 just gets spent on "stuff"
    	We need a "Savings Account":
    		Anything unspent goes into savings
    		Add alarms - 'alarm at 10k' - to prompt something like a deposit

    Timeline
    	Hook onto the gameLoop
    	Trigger events when the date is right
    	UI :: Tick off events when triggered

    Timeline (or something else?)
    	Need to be able to log achievements like:
    		"Paid off your loan"
    		"Bought a car"
    		"Went on holiday"
    	These are linked to user decisions, not the system itself

	Videos for different features
		https://accredible.slack.com/archives/watercooler/p1484068289000235

	UI
		Make some improvements

	Assets & Lifestyle
		I need a section that shows the current "state" of the user
		House is nice
		Car is shitty
		Holidays are fancy
		Chiildren are numerous
		etc.

	Moneys
		Carefully consider how to render +ve and -ve amounts

	Make sure the README is updated (in due course)

	Onboarding
		Enable each card in succession
			1 - User clicks "begin"
			2 - User can press Play
			3 - User can make decisions
			4 - User can drill down into their assets etc.
		Try just using the :hover style on the next card that needs interaction
		Bonus
			Implement Lord Mountbutton
			Maybe as Lord Moneybollocks

	This interface is pretty gorgeous

	Ledger
		Consider how this needs to work

    Salary
    	New Service

    Loan
    	Render the chart (quick!)
    	Switch to Google Charts (it has no performance hit)
    	Use a plugin:
	    	angular-google-chart:
	    		http://angular-google-chart.github.io/angular-google-chart/
	    	(my) demo:
	    		http://plnkr.co/edit/vClMpGerBS6WTP49f5DG?p=preview
	    I think we should pre-pad the chart with NULL values
	    Min / Max

	Mockup the UI

	Loan
		Link to gameloop

	GameLoop
		Add a Tick Service
		Simple PubSub needed
