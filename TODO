TODO

Tick Service
	Simple PubSub needed

Mock this up visually

Make sure the README is updated (in due course)

I need a section that shows the current "state" of the user
	House is nice
	Car is shitty
	etc.

Onboarding
	Enable each card in succession
		1 - User clicks "begin"
		2 - User can press Play
		3 - User can make decisions
		4 - User can drill down into their assets etc.
	Try just using the :hover style on the next card that needs interaction

Ledger
	Shows all transactions

Timeline
	Shows upcoming events
		Payrise
		Wedding - (one-off expense, adds to income)
		Baby - (costs ramp up for 21 years)
		Retirement

Loan
	Link to gameloop

Bonus
	Implement Lord Mountbutton
	Maybe as Lord Moneybollocks

This interface is pretty gorgeous
